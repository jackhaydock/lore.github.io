The {{ page.title }}, like the [Age of Empires](/404) before it, was a period of rapid imperialist expansion as the superpowers of the world sought to conquer and claim the entire world. It began with the rise of gunpowder weapons and the [TODO invasion](/404) and ended {{ page.duration }} later with the invention of the [TODO machine](/404).
