Whilst, unlike the [Age of Chaos](/history/ages/chaos), some records and artifacts do exist from the {{ page.title }}, it is still a very unclear period of human history. The majority of stories from this era were passed down countless generations through oral tradition.

The age official begins with the estimated creation date of the [Red Wall](/misc/redwall) and ends with [TODO](/404).
