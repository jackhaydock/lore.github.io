The most commonly used calendar in [Versera](/404) is the Diamon calendar. This calendar uses the creation of [The Red Wall](/misc/redwall) as it's epoch, with every before the wall being known as the [Age of Chaos](/history/ages/chaos) and everything afterwards being split into multiple ages.

Years
---
In the Diamon system there are several ways to write the year:

### Years since epoch
The simplest, and most common method of writing the year is to simply write the number of years since the epoch like so:
```
1200 AE
```
This is 1200 years after epoch.

### Years since beginning of age
Years can also be written as the number of years since the beginning of the age in which the year resides:
```
400 A2
```
This is 400 years since the beginning of the 2nd age (i.e. the [Age of Empires](/history/ages/empire)) or 6400AE.

### Years before age/epoch
Sometimes referring to a date by what comes after is useful, such as referring to a date before the epoch. For this the following notation can be used:
```
200 BE
or
200 B2
```
These refer to 200 years before the epoch and 200 years before the beginning of the 2nd age respectfully.

Months
---
There are ten months in a Diamon year, each roughly ending at the [conjunction of the two moons](/misc/moons), when the smaller, Rubur, passes in front of the larger, Caeru. Each month is composed of 6 weeks and 36 days with odd numbered months having 37 days. The names of these months are:
1. Aune
2. Dairu
3. Tritus
4. Ceinir
5. Hogith
6. Penlir
7. Rubol
8. Cache
9. Orith
10. Deius

Weeks
---
There are 6 days in a week:
1. Day of the Wolf
2. Day of the Lion
3. Day of the Bear
4. Day of the Horse
5. Day of the Stag
6. Day of the Raven

The ordering of the animals comes from the story of [TODO](/404).

Using the above, the 14th day of the 7th month of the 674th of the 3rd age, could be written in the following ways:
- 14/7/10,874 AE
- 14/7/674 A3
- 14th Rubol 10,874 AE
- 14th Rubol 674 A3
