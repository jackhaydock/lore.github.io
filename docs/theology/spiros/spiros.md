Spirism is the belief that everything animal, vegetable or mineral, including the planet itself, is a living being that possesses its own spirit. When this being dies, its Spiros transfers to another being.

For example, a plant dies to feed an animal, the animal uses the Spiros to grow, the animal then dies and feeds the dirt beneath it, the dirt then feeds plants and so on.

The same is true of things not usually considered "living", rocks give way to rivers, which in turn give Spiros to the animals and plants that drink from it.
