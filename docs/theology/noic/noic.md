Noicism is a collective term for the various pagan and druidic faiths of the Noic region, in northern Uros, before [TODO](/404) made [Meosian Caethism](/faiths/four/meos) the standard faith across Uros.

## The Two Sisters

In the beginning, there was naught but barren, flat land and empty seas. **Griág**, the sun, mated with the blue moon, **[Caeru](/misc/moons)**, to conceive twins, **Caérag** and **Farra**. **Griag** also secretly mated with **Caeru's** sister, the red moon, **[Rubur](/misc/moons)**.

Their secret was reveled when **Rubur** gave birth to **Andae**, the third brother. In fury, **Caeru** cast **Andae** to the world below, in retaliation, **Rubur** also banished **Caérag** and **Farra**.

The two sisters have remained in constant battle ever since, eternally circling each other in the night sky with **Griág** keeping his distance.

## The Three Brothers

The three sons fell to the world below.

**Caérag**, the largest took the rock and fashioned a bride, **Méara**, and they birthed the **Alachs**, the first rock giants. The alachs in turn birthed many beasts of the land and hills, such as goats, bears and horses.

**Farra**, the next largest, made the seas **Préa** and **Múra** as his brides. From **Farra** and **Préa's** union came the **Kelpie**, water spirits. The Kelpie carved out rivers and marshes through the land. **Múra** gave birth to the fish of the rivers and seas.

The smallest of the three, **Andae**, also took a bride, this one of the dirt, **Séra**. With her, **Andae** fathered the trees and grasses of the land as well as all the creatures of the forest, the deer, the birds and the **Duín**, humans.

## The Kin War

For eons, the brothers existed in harmony with **Caérag** ruling the mountains, **Farra** the seas and **Andae** the forests.

However, **Méara** was growing resentful of **Farra's** wives and how they and their kelpie kept cutting through rock and slowly reduced her own kingdom. When a sizable chunk of cliff face collapsed into **Préa's** sea, **Méara** took revenge and launched [great shards](/404) of salt rock into into the bay, killing a number of kelpie and greatly injuring **Préa** herself.

**Farra** went to **Caérag** and demanded justice for his wife but **Caérag** sided with his own wife and stubbornly refused. Tensions rose and when it seemed clear war was inevitable, both twins approached their half-brother **Andae** to gather support.

Initially, **Andae** refused, stating conflict was between the brothers and their wives and he had no part in it.

*TODO: Incite Andae to oppose both twins and children of each brother gets involved*

While the alachs had strengh and the kelpie had speed, the duín had courage, numbers and the creativity to make new weapons and tools to combat the rock and water. Where it took kelpie years to drill through rock, duín did it in weeks with pickaxes and shovels.

Where the alachs' bodies fell became the mountains and hills overgrown by grass and trees. Where the kelpie fell became ponds and lakes, cutoff from their mother and father.

*TODO: Add significant final conflict*

## The Aftermath

**Andae** emerged victorious, he did not slay his brothers but instead banished them and cursed their children to remain mindless beasts under the rule of the Duín.

**Caérag** and **Méara** were sealed deep underground, their rage and screams can occasionally be heard as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

**Farra** and his wives are hidden deep in the ocean, their rage can be heard as violent waves and storms. **Múra** is a curious woman and creeps up to land everyday before timidly fleeing back into the water, this is noticeable as the tides.

**Andae** and **Séra** now wander the forests speaking to the trees, animals and occasionally the duín.
