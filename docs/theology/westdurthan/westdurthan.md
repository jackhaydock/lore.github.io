West Durthan Myth, often refered to as just "Western Myth", is not an organised religion. Rather it is a collective of folklore stories, poetic epics and myths originating from the western regions of the southern Durtha continent, most notably from the coastal cities surrounding the Sea of Cyranos.

While some stories had made their way into more recent folklore and other faiths, the west durthan tales were largely considered just myths and legends by the begining of the [Age of Kings](/history/ages/kings).
