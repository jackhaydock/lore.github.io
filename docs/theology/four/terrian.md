While one of the less popular divisions of Ceithism, Terrian Ceitheism is perhaps the oldest known form of Ceitheism, with possible origins in both [West Durthan Myth](/theology/western) and [Noicism](/faiths/noic)

Like other forms of Ceitheism, this revolves around four deities, however these deities are; the Sun, the two moons, [Caeru and Rubur](/misc/moons) and Versera itself.

It is inconsistent whether each of the Four are/have their own world with mortals residing on them, or if Versera is the only one and the other gods choose to assist Versera in sustaining mortal life upon her. The later lends credence to idea that Versera is the Life deity from other Ceithic faiths, being the only one to sustain life.
