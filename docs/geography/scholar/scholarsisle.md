Scholars' Isle is a small archipelago in the Sea of Astra almost equal distances from the continents of [Uros](/geo/uros), [North Durtha](/geo/durtha/north) and [South Durtha](/geo/durtha/north). Since the early [Age of Empires](/ages/empires) (Approximately 2-120), there has existed at least one institution of academia that declares itself apolitical and areligious. The [Academy of Natural Philosophy](/geo/scholar/anp) claims to be the oldest surviving of these, in the years since there have been well over a dozen academies, universities and societies dedicated to the study of science, medicine, philosophy, history and many other fields.

All faiths are welcome on the isle, provided they do disrupt or attempt to suppress any people or studies outside their faith.

Many of the academies offer inclusive recruitment, anyone may join regardless of nationality or faith provided they prove themselves capable and obey the rules of the isles, a "generous donation" also tends to help with securing entry. Some establishments are more exclusive in who they accept however, for example, the [College of Learned Gentleman](/geo/scholar/clg) only accepts unmarried, childless men over the age of 40 who are able to afford the high entry costs.

Despite the inclusiveness of the isles, only one institution ever accepted women before the [TODO](/404) in the year 432 A5 (14,832 AE), the [Elphi Institute](/geo/scholar/ei) which itself was founded by two sisters, Dyna and Reina, in the year 3173 A2 (9173 AE).
