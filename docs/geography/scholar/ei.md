The {{ page.title }} is an academic institution founded in 3173 A2 (9173 AE). It is perhaps most famous for being the only institution on [Scholars' Isle](/404) to accept women for 5659 years until the [TODO](/404) when six other colleges signed an agreement to accept women.

It was founded by two sisters, Dyna and Reina Elphi, who in defiance of their father chose not marry and hand over their inheritance to husbands, but to instead purchase land, books and hire masons to build a great hall dedicated to science, history and medicine. For nearly 20 years, the {{ page.title }} only accepted women as staff and students, however they later allowed men. It was nearly 2000 years before a man was allowed to serve on the senior board of directors. There has never been a male chairman of the {{ page.title }}'s board.
