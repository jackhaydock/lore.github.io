The most commonly used calendar in [Versera](/404) is the Diamon calendar. This calendar uses the creation of [The Red Wall](/relics/redwall) as it's epoch, with every before the wall being known as the [Age of Chaos](/ages/chaos) and everything afterwards being split into multiple ages.

---

Years
---
The notation for years in the Diamon Calendar as follows:

```
age-year
```

For example the 400th year of the 2nd age (the [Age of Empires](/ages/empires)) would be:

```
2-400
```

For years prior to the specified age, the following can be used:
```
1-400b
```
The above signifies 400 years before the beginning of the 1st age.

Months
---
There are ten months in a Diamon year, each ending at the eclipse of the two moons, when [Caeru](/404) passes behind [Rubur](/404) and hides for a day. Each month is composed of 6 weeks and 36 days. The names of these months are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7. Rubol
8.
9.
10.

Weeks
---
There are 6 days in a week:
1. Day of the Wolf
2. Day of the Lion
3. Day of the Bear
4. Day of the Horse
5. Day of the Stag
6. Day of the Raven

The ordering of the animals comes from the story of [TODO](/404).

Using the above, the 14th day of the 7th month of the 674th of the 3rd age, could be written as:
```
3-674-7-14
or
14th Rubol 3-674
```
