The Age of Chaos effectively refers to pre-history, before human civilization or, by some accounts, before humanity itself. With no hard evidence or records at all of what occurred during this time, all the stories we do have are pure speculation and theology.

The length of this era is also greatly debated. Some religious accounts claim that this era did not exist as time itself did not exist until the simultaneous creation of everything, humans included.

If this period did indeed exist, it officially ends with [The Red Wall](/relics/redwall) in the caves of [TODO](/404), the oldest known piece writing in existence. The estimated date of the mural's creation is often used as the epoch of many calendars, including the commonly used [Diamon Calendar](/ages/calendar).

*TODO: Write more, give multiple creation stories and theories*
