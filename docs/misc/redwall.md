Deep inside the [TODO(Cave system)](/404) in [TODO (place)](/404) there sits a large stone mural carved into the wall of the cave. This wall, and the mural upon it, are considered by many to be the oldest surviving creation of humans in the known world. The stone is a deep red quartz which appears to shine under the correct light, hence the name, The Red Wall.

The Wall
---
The Red Wall is carved into the walls of the cave itself and is approximately 30ft (9m) tall, 90ft (27m) long and set nearly 3ft (1m) into the surrounding wall. It is unclear how the primitive peoples of the time dug out this stone but it is clearly not natural.

The Mural

The mural on the wall depicts many scenes of figures and symbols loosely connected.

Date
---
Scholars are able to date the piece by the two comets, [Hyna](/404) and [Theros](/404) that appear in the night sky depicted atop the piece. These comets only appear simultaneously every 12,000 years. By this estimation, the Red Wall pre-dates other dateable artifacts by a little less than 300 years.

Given this is the earliest known human work that we are able to date with some precision, its creation has become the epoch of many calendars, including the globally used [Diamon Calendar](/ages/calendar). It also serves as the official beginning of the [Age of Heroes](/ages/heroes).
