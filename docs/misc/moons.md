Caeru and it's smaller counter-part, Rubur, form the twin moons of Versera. Caeru is the larger blue moon around which the smaller, red moon, Rubur, orbits. Both moons cycle Versera roughly once every 30 days. Coincidently, Rubur also orbits Caeru roughly every 30 days, meaning more often than not a full Caeru and Rubar coincides with "The Conjunction", when Rubar passes in front of Caeru, appearing briefly as a single blue moon with a large red dot. In the [Diamon Calendar](/history/calendar), each month ends with the monthly conjunction.

A "Shy Rubur" is when Rubur is completely hidden behind Caeru.

The pair's relative sizes differ throughout their cycle. Just before and after the shy Rubur, Rubur can appear less than a third the size of Caeru but during a conjunction, Rubur can appear roughly two thirds the size of Caeru.

In some myths, Rubar is depicted as a young, shy childlike deity while Caeru is the older, protective, sister or mother (sometimes both). The sun, Griac, is usually depicted as the father while Versera is the mother of both (or sometimes just Caeru).
